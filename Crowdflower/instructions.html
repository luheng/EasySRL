    <p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help!&nbsp;The robot will ask you questions when itâ€™s confused about the structure of a sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

    <blockquote>Stockholders who took advice from experts escaped the October debacle.</blockquote>

    <p>The robot might ask:</p>

    <blockquote>What escaped the October debacle?</blockquote>

    <p>along with the following options as possible answers:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>stockholders</li>

        <li>advice</li>

        <li>experts</li>

        <li>Answer not listed</li>

        <li>Question is not valid</li>
    </ol>

    <p>What you need to do is to choose the correct answer:&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">1. stockholders</span>.</em></strong></p>

    <h3><strong>Reading Questions</strong></h3>

    <p>The robot-generated questions are not perfect. There are sometimes mistakes in tense, capitalization and choice of words (e.g., "who" vs. "what", "someone" vs. "something", or forgetting a "not"). In case of these minor errors, please try your best to give the correct answer. However, if you think the question is nonsensical, or is not answerable given the sentence, please choose the option <strong style="line-height: 1.72222;"><em><u>Question is not valid</u></em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>For example, given the sentence:</p>

    <blockquote>They included free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

    <p>Examples of <strong><em><u>valid questions</u></em></strong>&nbsp;include (but are not limited to):</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What would they do for $3 a month?</span></blockquote>

    <p>However, the following question:</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would safe-deposit travelers checks?</span></blockquote>

    <p><em style="font-weight: bold;"><u>is not valid</u>.</em>&nbsp;Furthermore, the question</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would travelers checks be for?</span></blockquote>

    <p><strong><em><u>is&nbsp;not valid</u></em></strong>, even though it is grammatical, because it's not answered directly by the sentence. As another example, consider the sentence:</p>

    <blockquote>The company said it expects to complete the transaction by year end.</blockquote>

    <p>The question</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would the transaction be by?</span></blockquote>

    <p><strong><u><em>is not valid</em></u></strong>. Even though the question may sound grammatical, and the sentence does <span style="color: #B8312F;">implicitly suggest</span> that the transaction would take place by year end, the phrase "<em>by year end</em>" in the sentence only <span style="color: #41A85F;">explicitly refers</span> to <em>completing</em>&nbsp;the transaction. So examples of acceptable questions include:</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What would it complete the transaction by?</span></blockquote>

    <p>with the answer, e.g.,&nbsp;<em><span style="color: #41A85F;">year end</span></em>, and</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What would it do by year end?</span></blockquote>

    <p>with the answer <em><span style="color: #41A85F;">complete the transaction</span></em>.</p>

    <h3><strong>Choosing the Best Answer</strong></h3>

    <p>There may be multiple answer options that are <strong><em><u>related</u></em></strong>&nbsp;to the question, but you need to choose the one that most accurately <strong><em><u>answers</u></em></strong>&nbsp;the question. For example, given the sentence:</p>

    <blockquote>Japan 's domestic sales of cars in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units.</blockquote>

    <p>and the question:</p>

    <blockquote>What rose?</blockquote>

    <p>Correct answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">Japan 's domestic sales of cars", "domestic sales", "sales".</span></em></strong> Wrong answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #B8312F;">Japan", &nbsp;"Japan 's domestic", "cars"</span></em></strong>. Usually there is only one correct answer among listed options. When there are multiple correct answers, please choose the <u><strong><em>shortest</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>correct</em></strong></u>&nbsp;one, such as:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Japan's domestic sales of cars</li>

        <li><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><strong><em><u>domestic sales</u></em></strong></span></li>

        <li>cars</li>

        <li>Answer not listed</li>

        <li>Question is not valid</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Sometimes a question has&nbsp;<strong><em><u>multiple&nbsp;answers</u></em></strong>. These will be separated by a bold&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">&amp;</strong> symbol within the answer choices. For example, given the sentence:</p>

    <blockquote>They included free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

    <p>and the question:</p>

    <blockquote>What did they include?</blockquote>

    <p>the following answer:</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;"> free checking <strong>&amp; </strong>a safe-deposit box <strong>&amp;</strong>&nbsp;travelers checks</span></blockquote>

    <p>is a better answer than the other candidates such as:</p>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks</span></blockquote>

    <blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking <strong>&amp;</strong> a safe-deposit box</span></blockquote>

    <p> If you think there is a correct answer to the question, but none of the listed ones is acceptable, please go with the option <strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;"><em><u>Answer is not listed</u></em>.</strong></p>

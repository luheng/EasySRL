<h3><strong>Can you answer the question using information in the sentence?</strong></h3>

<h3>Overview </h3>

<p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help on this!&nbsp;The robot will ask you questions when it’s confused about the meaning or the structure of a sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Stockholders who took advices from experts escaped the October debacle.</blockquote>

<p>The robot might ask:</p>

<blockquote>What escaped the October debacle?</blockquote>

<p>along with the following options as possible answers:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #41A85F;"><u><em>stockholders</em></u></span></strong></li>

    <li>advices</li>

    <li>experts</li>

    <li>Answer not listed.</li>

    <li>Question is not valid&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>what you need to do is to choose the correct answer -<strong><em>“<u>1. stockholders</u>”.</em></strong></p>

<h3>About Reading Questions</h3>

<p>The robot-generated questions are not perfect. There are sometimes mistakes in tense, capitalization and choice of words (i.e. "who" vs. "what", "someone" vs. "something"). Please try your best to give the correct answer. However, if you think the question is completely not understandable, or is not answerable given the sentence, please choose the option <strong style="line-height: 1.72222;"><em>“<u>Question is not valid</u>”</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>They included free checking, a credit-card, and self-deposit travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

<p>Examples of <strong><em><u>valid questions</u></em></strong>&nbsp;are (but not limited to):</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What would they do for $3 a month?</span></blockquote>

<p>However, the following question:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would safe-deposit travelers checks?</span></blockquote>

<p><strong><em><u>is not valid</u>.</em></strong></p>

<h3>About Choosing the Best Answer</h3>

<p>There could be multiple options that are "<strong><em><u>related</u></em></strong>" to the question, but you need to choose the one that most accurately "<strong><em><u>answers</u></em></strong>" the question. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Japan 's domestic sales of cars &nbsp;in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units.</blockquote>

<p>and the question:</p>

<blockquote>What rose?</blockquote>

<p>Correct answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">Japan 's domestic sales of cars", "domestic sales", "sales".</span></em></strong> Wrong answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #B8312F;">Japan", &nbsp;"Japan 's domestic", "cars"</span></em></strong>. Usually there is only one correct answer among listed options. When there are multiple correct answers, please choose the <u><strong><em>shortest</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>correct</em></strong></u>one, such as:</p>

<ol style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 25.8333px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    <li style="font-style: normal; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: #000000;">Japan's domestic sales of cars</span></li>

    <li style="box-sizing: border-box;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><em><u>domestic sales</u></em></span></strong></li>

    <li style="font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; box-sizing: border-box;">cars</li>

    <li style="font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; box-sizing: border-box;">Answer not listed.</li>

    <li style="font-style: normal; font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; box-sizing: border-box;">Question is not valid&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes the answer to the question is <strong><em><u>a list of things</u></em></strong>, and those are juxtaposed with a bold&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;">&amp;</strong> symbol in between. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>They included free checking, a credit-card, and self-deposit travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;question:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">the following answer:</span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;"> free checking <strong>&amp; </strong>a credit-card <strong>&amp;</strong> self-deposit travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<p>is a better answer than the other candidates such as:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking, a credit-card and self-deposit travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking <strong>&amp;</strong> a credit-card</span></blockquote>

<p> If you think there is a correct answer to the question, but none of the listed ones is acceptable, please go with the option <strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;"><em>"<u>Answer is not listed</u>"</em>.</strong></p>

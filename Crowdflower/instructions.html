<p><strong>Can you answer the question using information in the sentence?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Overview </h3>

<p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help on this!&nbsp;The robot asks questions when it’s confused about information in the sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Stockholders who took advices from experts escaped the October debacle.</blockquote>

<p>The robot will ask:</p>

<blockquote>What escaped the October debacle?</blockquote>

<p>and will represent you with the following choices:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong><span style="color: #41A85F;">stockholders</span></strong></li>

    <li>experts</li>

    <li>Answer not listed.</li>

    <li>Question is not understandable.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>what you need to do is to choose the correct answer -<strong><em>“1. stockholders”.</em></strong></p>

<h3>About Reading Questions</h3>

<p>The robot-generated questions are not perfect. There are sometimes mistakes in tense, capitalization and choice of words (i.e. "who" vs. "what").&nbsp;However, if you think the question is completely not understandable/ungrammatical, or not answerable given the sentence, please choose the option <strong style="line-height: 1.72222;"><em>“Question is not valid”</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, given sentence:</p>

<blockquote>They included free checking, a credit-card, and self-deposit travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

<p>Examples of <strong>valid questions</strong>&nbsp;are (but not limited to):</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What would they do for $3 a month?</span></blockquote>

<p>However, the following question:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would safe-deposit travelers checks?</span></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>is not valid.</em></strong></p>

<h3>About Choosing from Answers</h3>

<p>Sometimes there are multiple answer to a question, and those are split with a bold&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;">&amp;</strong> symbol. For example, given the question:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">the answer:</span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;"> free checking <strong>&amp; </strong>a credit-card <strong>&amp;</strong> self-deposit travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<p>is a better answer over the following candidates:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking, a credit-card and self-deposit travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking <strong>&amp;</strong> a credit-card</span></blockquote>

<p> If you think there is a correct answer to the question, but that answer is not listed in the options, please go with the option <strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;"><em>"Answer is not listed"</em>.</strong></p>

<p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help! This task is a good fit for you if 1) You are a native speaker of English and 2) You have good understanding of our task by going through the instructions and examples.</p>

<p>In this task, the robot will ask you questions when it’s confused about the structure of a sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>The pretentious gentleman always
    <mark>orders</mark> spaghetti with meatballs in Italian.</blockquote>

<p>The robot may ask:</p>

<blockquote>What is it that the pretentious gentleman would order?</blockquote>

<p>with the answer choices:</p>

<ul>
    <li>spaghetti</li>
    <li>spaghetti with meatballs</li>
    <li>spaghetti in Italian</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, there are two correct answers: <em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">spaghetti</span></em> and <em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">spaghetti with meatballs</span></em>. The answer <em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">spaghetti in Italian</span></em> is incorrect because it suggests that the spaghetti would be "in Italian," which doesn't make sense and isn't what the sentence meant. Rather, his <em>order</em> was in Italian.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Part of the question is highlighted in the sentence to make the task easier. But <strong><u>please read the whole sentence</u></strong> before making you choice.</li>
    <li dir="ltr">Choose the <strong><u>all</u></strong> the options that <strong><u>explicitly</u>,&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>directly</u></strong> and <strong><u>accurately</u></strong> answer the question.</li>
    <li dir="ltr">Select “None of the above” if 1) none of the listed answers is good enough, 2) the question is nonsensical, or 3) the question is not answerable given the information in the sentence.</li>
    <li dir="ltr">Please read the examples carefully, as they will help you understand the task better.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Important Notes:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The robot may make mistakes between "<strong>who</strong>" and "<strong>what</strong>," and "<strong>someone</strong>" and "<strong>something</strong>." A question such as "What is it that something supported" can still be answered with "John", if that's what the sentence says.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>The robot might forget to say "<strong>not</strong>" in the question. For example, given the sentence "I refuse to eat cake" and the question "What eats something?", the answer should be "I".</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example #1:</h4>

<blockquote>However, that pretentious gentlemen failed to
    <mark>eat</mark> his spaghetti with the tiny fork.
    <br>- What is it that someone would eat?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>his spaghetti</li>
    <li>his spaghetti with the tiny fork</li>
    <li>None of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>The only correct answer is <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">his spaghetti</span></em></strong>, and <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">his spaghetti with the tiny fork</span></em></strong> is a wrong answer. Because "the tiny fork" is not part of what the gentlemen failed to eat. Also, although the question is missing a "not", it is still answerable.</p>

<h4>

</h4>

<h4>Example #2:</h4>

<blockquote>Blue^3, the world leader in hoverboards, didn't
    <mark>offer</mark> its first hoverboard with voice control until 2020.
    <br>- What is it that something would offer?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>its first hoverboard</li>
    <li>its first hoverboard with voice control</li>
    <li>its first hoverboard until 2020</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers are <span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><em style="font-weight: bold;">its first hoverboard&nbsp;</em></span>and<span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">&nbsp;<strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95); ">its first hoverboard with voice control</span></em>
	</strong>
	</span>. Because the sentence directly states that "hoverboard" is offered, and "with voice control" clearly describes the hoverboard, hence can be part of the answer. The other answer, <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47); "><em style="font-weight: bold; ">its first hoverboard until 2020&nbsp;</em></span>is wrong because "until 2020 " describes the action of "offering ", not the thing being offered.</p>

<h4>
    <br>
</h4>

<h4>Example #3:</h4>

<blockquote>The hoverboard company
    <mark>added</mark> a $300 service fee to its base price.
    <br>- What is it that something would add?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>a $300 service fee</li>
    <li>a $300 service fee to its base price</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only correct answer is <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">a $300 service fee</span></em></strong>. The other answer, <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">a $300 service fee to its base price</span></em></strong> is incorrect because the phrase "to its base price" is describes "adding", rather than what is being added.</p>

<p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help!&nbsp;The robot will ask you questions when itâ€™s confused about the structure of a sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Stockholders who took advice from experts escaped the October debacle.</blockquote>

<p>The robot might ask:</p>

<blockquote>What escaped the October debacle?</blockquote>

<p>along with the following options as possible answers:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong><u><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">stockholders</span></em></u></strong></li>

    <li>advice</li>

    <li>experts</li>

    <li>Answer not listed</li>

    <li>Question is not valid</li>
</ol>

<p>What you need to do is to choose the correct answer:&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">1. stockholders</span>.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Reading Questions</strong></h3>

<p>The robot-generated questions are not perfect. There are sometimes mistakes in tense, capitalization and choice of words (e.g., "who" vs. "what", "someone" vs. "something", or forgetting a "not"). In case of these minor errors, please try your best to give the correct answer. However, if you think the question is nonsensical, or is not answerable given the sentence, please choose the option <strong><em><u>Question is not valid</u></em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>They included free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

<p>Here is a&nbsp;<strong><em><u>valid question</u></em></strong>:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;">What did they include?</span></blockquote>

<p>However, the following question:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">What would safe-deposit travelers checks?</span></blockquote>

<p><em style="font-weight: bold;"><u>is not valid</u>.</em>&nbsp;Because it is neither grammatical, nor answerable given the sentence.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong style="color: black;">Choosing the Best Answer</strong></h3>

<p>There may be multiple answer options that are related&nbsp;to the question, but you need to choose the one that most accurately answers&nbsp;the question. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Japan 's domestic sales of cars in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units.</blockquote>

<p>and the question:</p>

<blockquote>What rose?</blockquote>

<p>Correct answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">Japan 's domestic sales of cars", "domestic sales", "sales".</span></em></strong> Wrong answers would include: "<strong><em><span style="color: #B8312F;">Japan", &nbsp;"Japan 's domestic", "cars"</span></em></strong>. Because according to the sentence, "sales" rose, not "cars" or "Japan". Usually there is only one correct answer among listed options. When there are multiple correct answers, please choose the <u><strong><em>shortest</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>correct</em></strong></u>&nbsp;one, such as:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Japan's domestic sales of cars</li>

    <li><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><strong><em><u>domestic sales</u></em></strong></span></li>

    <li>cars</li>

    <li>Answer not listed</li>

    <li>Question is not valid</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Knowing a tasty meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .</blockquote>

<p>and question:</p>

<blockquote><span data-sheets-userformat="[null,null,8961,[null,0],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,0,null,null,null,9]" data-sheets-value="[null,2,&amp;quot;What would they eat?&amp;quot;]">What would they eat?</span></blockquote>

<p>the best, and <strong><u><em>most direct</em></u></strong> answer is <span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">"<em style="font-weight: bold;">one</em>"<span style="color: #000000;">,</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">instead of "<strong><em><span style="color: #B8312F;">a tasty meal</span></em></strong>". Because although the latter contains more information, &nbsp;"one" is the directly and explicitly mentioned by the sentence as in the part "... when they eat one".</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Similarly, the most direct answer for the question</span></p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">What would eat one?</span></blockquote>

<p>is "<strong><em><span style="color: #41A85F;">they</span></em></strong>", instead of "<strong><em><span style="color: #B8312F;">the executives</span></em></strong>".</p>
<hr>
<p><strong style="color: black; line-height: 1.72222;">Multiple Applicable Answers</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes a question has&nbsp;<strong><em><u>multiple&nbsp;answers</u></em></strong>. These will be separated by a bold&nbsp;slash symbol <strong>/</strong> within the answer choices. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>They included free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks for only $3 a month.</blockquote>

<p>and the question:</p>

<blockquote>What did they include?</blockquote>

<p>the following answer:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #41A85F;"> free checking &nbsp;<strong>/ &nbsp;</strong>a safe-deposit box &nbsp;<strong>/</strong>&nbsp; travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<p>is a better answer than the other candidates such as:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="color: #B8312F;">free checking &nbsp;<strong>/&nbsp;</strong> a safe-deposit box</span></blockquote>

<p>As a special case, when the sentence lists a person/company with a describing phrase next to it, such as:</p>

<blockquote>J.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., was elected a director.</blockquote>

<p>Please choose an answer that lists both of them, such as:</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">J.P. Bolduc &nbsp;<strong>/</strong>&nbsp; vice chairman of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.</span></blockquote>

<p>If you think there is a correct answer to the question, but none of the listed ones is acceptable, please go with the option <strong style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.72222;"><em><u>Answer is not listed</u></em>.</strong></p>

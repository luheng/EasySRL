<p>We want to teach our smart robot to understand human language and we need your help! This task is a good fit for you if 1) You are a native speaker of English and 2) You have good understanding of our task by going through the instructions and examples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The robot will ask you questions when it’s confused about the structure of a sentence. For example, given the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle.</blockquote>

<p>The robot might ask:</p>

<blockquote>What
    <mark>escaped</mark> something?</blockquote>

<p>along with the following options as possible answers:</p>

<ul>
    <li>stockholders</li>
    <li>the hint</li>
    <li>shares</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to choose every correct answer. In this case, there is just one: <span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><strong><em>stockholders</em></strong></span>.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Part of the question is highlighted in the sentence to make the task easier. But <strong><u>please read the whole sentence</u></strong> before making you choice.</li>
    <li dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Choose the options that <strong><u>explicitly</u>,&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>directly</u></strong> and <strong><u>accurately</u></strong> answer the question&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">(See examples #1 and #2)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></li>
    <li dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Check <strong><u>multiple</u></strong> options if <strong><u>all</u></strong> of them are needed to answer the question, otherwise pick the <strong><u>shortest</u></strong> one that satisfies Guideline No. 2&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">&nbsp;(See examples #2 and #3).</span></li>
    <li dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Select “None of the above” if 1) none of the listed answers is good enough, 2) the question is nonsensical, or 3) the question is not answerable given the information in the sentence.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">(See example #4)</span></li>
    <li dir="ltr">Please read the examples carefully, as they will help you understand the task better.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Important Notes:</strong> There are two kinds of errors in questions that you should forgive.</span></p>

<ol>
    <li>The robot may make mistakes between "<strong>who</strong>" and "<strong>what</strong>," and "<strong>someone</strong>" and "<strong>something</strong>." A question such as "What likes something" can still be answered with &nbsp;"I", if that's what the sentence says.</li>
    <li>The robot might forget to say "<strong>not</strong>" in the question. For example, given the sentence "I refuse to eat cake" and the question "What eats something?", the answer should be "I".</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In these cases, do not necessarily mark "None of the above". Instead, proceed as though the error had not been made.</span></p>
<hr>

<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Example #1:</strong></span></h4>

<blockquote>I
    <mark>like</mark> many kinds of fruit, including apples and oranges.
    <br>- What does someone like?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>many kinds of fruit</li>
    <li>apples</li>
    <li>oranges</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should only answer<strong>&nbsp;</strong><em style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">many kinds of fruit&nbsp;</span></em> for this question. Even though you could conclude that "I like apples<em>"</em> is true, and likewise for the other answers, they are not stated <strong><u>directly</u></strong> in the sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    <br>
</p>

<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Example #2:</strong></span></h4>

<blockquote>Japan's domestic sales of cats in October, as they reported,
    <mark>rose</mark> 300% from a year earlier.
    <br>- What rose?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>Japan 's domestic</li>
    <li>Japan 's domestic sales of cats in October</li>
    <li>sales</li>
    <li>cats</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best answer should be <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">sales</span></em></strong>, because *sales* is the thing that rose. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(184, 49, 47);"><em>cats</em></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and</span><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);"><em style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</em></span><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);"><strong style="font-style: italic;">Japan's domestic&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);"><strong style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">are <strong><u>inaccurate</u></strong> because they are not what the question is asking about.&nbsp;</span><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">Japan's domestic sales of cats in October</span></em></strong> also answers the question, but we favor the shorter answer in this case.</p>

<h4>
    <br>
</h4>

<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Example #3:</strong></span></h4>

<blockquote>They
    <mark>provided</mark> free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers checks for only $3 a month.
    <br>- What did something provide?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>free checking</li>
    <li>safe-deposit box</li>
    <li>travelers checks</li>
    <li>$3</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Correct answers are <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">free checking</span></em></strong>, <span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);"><strong><em>safe-deposit box</em></strong></span>, and <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(65, 168, 95);">travelers checks</span></em></strong>, because all these three things are stated to be provided. <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">$3&nbsp;</span></em></strong>is &nbsp;incorrect because it isn't among the things being provided.</p>

<p>
    <br>
</p>

<h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong>Example #4:</strong></span></h4>

<blockquote>They provided free checking, a safe-deposit box and travelers
    <mark>checks</mark> for only $3 a month.
    <br>- What checks something?</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>they</li>
    <li>travelers</li>
    <li>None of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct answer is <strong><em><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">None of the above</span></em></strong>, since the question is nonsensical in the context of the question.</p>
